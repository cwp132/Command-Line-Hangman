# Command-Line-Hangman

Simple hangman game with easy medium and Hard difficulty. Written at work in my free time. Made with JavaScript and Inquirer. This project was to help me get back in to coding as its been a few months. A few bugs currently such as words with multiple of the same character only register the first letter seen in the array.
